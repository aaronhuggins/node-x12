# Node-X12

An ASC X12 parser, generator, query engine, and mapper written for NodeJS and
Deno. Parsing supports reading from Node streams to conserve resources in
memory-intensive operations.

## Installing

Simply import into your runtime: [Deno](https://deno.land/x/x12), browser,
[Node ESM, or Node CommonJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-x12). Browser
imports can be handled via your favorite bundler, or using Skypack CDN.

For NPM: `npm i node-x12`

## Features

Contributions by TrueCommerce up to April 2016:

- Near-complete class object model of ASC X12 parts
- Parser
- Query Engine

Enhancements original to this fork:

- Simplified object notation class for EDI (allows for easy JSON support)
- Streaming Parser (allows for parsing of large EDI files with reduced memory
  overhead)
- Generator
- Transaction set to object mapping
- Object to transaction set mapping, now with support for
  [Liquid syntax](/docs/TransactionMapping.md#liquid-macro-language)
- Support for fat EDI documents
- Convenience methods for several generating/mapping scenarios
- Intellisense support in VSCode with packaged type declarations

See the [API](/docs/API.md) for more information.

#### Future

This library is in
[maintenance mode as of 2021](https://github.com/aaronhuggins/node-x12/issues/24).
Development of a next-generation ASC X12 parser is taking place in
[js-edi](https://github.com/aaronhuggins/js-edi). This new library will support
both ASC X12 and EDIFACT, as well as a more fleshed-out query language, by
leveraging Antler4 grammars which closely follow publicly-provided details of
their specs.

### Query Language

The query language makes it possible to directly select values from the class
object model. See [Query Language](/docs/QueryLanguage.md) for more information.

**Example 1: Select `REF02` Elements**<br /> `REF02`

**Example 2: Select `REF02` Elements With a `PO` Qualifier in `REF01`**<br />
`REF02:REF01["PO"]`

**Example 3: Select Line-Level PO Numbers (850)**<br /> `PO1-REF02:REF01["PO"]`

**Example 4: Select ASN Line Quantities**<br /> `HL+S+O+P+I-LIN-SN102`

**Example 5: Select values from a loop series**<br />
`FOREACH(LX)=>MAN02:MAN01["CP"]`

### Fat EDI Documents

Some vendors will concatenate multiple valid EDI documents into a single request
or file. This **DOES NOT CONFORM** to the ASC X12 spec, but it does happen.
Implementing support for this scenario was trivial. When parsing an EDI
document, it will be handled one of two ways:

1. When strict, the parser will return an `X12FatInterchange` object with
   property `interchanges`, an array of `X12Interchange` objects
2. When not strict, the parser will merge valid EDI documents into a single
   interchange

In the latter of the two scenarios, the parser will set the header and trailer
to the last available ISA and IEA segments. The element data of the discarded
ISA and IEA segments will be lost if the original fat EDI document is not
preserved. If all the header and trailer information is important to your
organization, we recommend setting the parser to strict so that you get all the
data into an object, or else go back to your implementer and request that they
fix their EDI.

### Gotchas

Implementers of ASC X12 are not guaranteed to conform completely to spec. There
are scenarios that this library WILL NOT be able to handle and WILL NEVER be
added. Despite the addition of functionality beyond the base parser from the
original libray, the goal of this library is to remain a simple implementation
of the spec. Some examples of scenarios this library won't handle:

- Control characters in the content of an element
- Mixed encrypted/non-encrypted documents
- Missing elements in XYZ tag

Such issues should be resolved between a user of this library and the
implementer of ASC X12 documents they are working with.

## Documentation

Additional documentation can be found [self-hosted](/docs/TOC.md) within the
repository.

## Examples

```js
const { X12Generator, X12Parser, X12TransactionMap } = require("node-x12");

// Parse valid ASC X12 EDI into an object.
const parser = new X12Parser(true);
let interchange = parser.parse("...raw X12 data...");

// Parse a stream of valid ASC X12 EDI
const ediStream = fs.createReadStream("someFile.edi");
const segments = [];

ediStream
  .pipe(parser)
  .on("data", (data) => {
    segments.push(data);
  })
  .on("end", () => {
    interchange = parser.getInterchangeFromSegments(segments);
  });

// Generate valid ASC X12 EDI from an object.
const jsen = {
  options: {
    elementDelimiter: "*",
    segmentTerminator: "\n",
  },
  header: [
    "00",
    "",
    "00",
    "",
    "ZZ",
    "10000000",
    "01",
    "100000000",
    "100000",
    "0425",
    "|",
    "00403",
    "100748195",
    "0",
    "P",
    ">",
  ],
  functionalGroups: [...etc],
};
const generator = new X12Generator(jsen);

// Query X12 like an object model
const engine = new X12QueryEngine();
const results = engine.query(interchange, 'REF02:REF01["IA"]');

results.forEach((result) => {
  // Do something with each result.
  // result.interchange
  // result.functionalGroup
  // result.transaction
  // result.segment
  // result.element
  // result.value OR result.values
});

// Map transaction sets to javascript objects
const map = {
  status: "W0601",
  poNumber: "W0602",
  poDate: "W0603",
  shipto_name: 'N102:N101["ST"]',
  shipto_address: 'N1-N301:N101["ST"]',
  shipto_city: 'N1-N401:N101["ST"]',
  shipto_state: 'N1-N402:N101["ST"]',
  shipto_zip: 'N1-N403:N101["ST"]',
};

interchange.functionalGroups.forEach((group) => {
  group.transactions.forEach((transaction) => {
    console.log(transaction.toObject(map));
  });
});
```

## Credit

Created originally for the
[TC Toolbox](https://github.com/TrueCommerce/vscode-tctoolbox) project by
TrueCommerce; the public repository for TC Toolbox has been taken offline. The
original, parser-only library may be found at
[TrueCommerce/node-x12](https://github.com/TrueCommerce/node-x12), which is
still public at this time but no longer maintained. Without the good work done
by TrueCommerce up until 2016, this library would not exist.
